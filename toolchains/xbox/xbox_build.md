## Xbox Build

This SDK is kept compatible with Xbox but the actual toolchain, CI and integration tests are on a private repository because they rely on GDKX components that can't be made available on this repository and to avoid maintenance complexity everything was moved to the private repository.
We'll send an invite to the repository once you follow the steps documented: See [Xbox documentation](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/xbox/) to get access."
