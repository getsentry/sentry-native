# Suppress race on g_logger. The concurrent_init test is a stress test that should reveal
# synchronization issues in the initialization. Yes, the logger initialization is racy wrt
# the logging itself, but real usage calls sentry_init once per process and does not justify
# a mutex acquisition on every log
