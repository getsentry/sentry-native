# Not really sure if this is a real leak or just ASAN not correctly handling the autorelease pool.
# The leak is reported both from the `crashpad_handler` as well as sentry itself.
# Adding a manual `[paths release]` "fixes" the `crashpad_handler` leak, but leads to a use-after-free in sentry.

# This is a known issue in ASAN packaged with llvm15/16 (and below): https://github.com/google/sanitizers/issues/1501
# I cannot reproduce it with the current brew llvm package (18.1.7). TODO: remove when GHA macOS runner image updates the llvm package.
