# Official Sentry SDK for C/C++ <!-- omit in toc -->

The _Sentry Native SDK_ is an error and crash reporting client for native
applications, optimized for C and C++. Sentry allows to add tags, breadcrumbs
and arbitrary custom context to enrich error reports.

**Note**: This SDK is being actively developed and still in Beta. We recommend
to check for updates regularly to benefit from latest features and bug fixes.
Please see [Known Issues](#known-issues).

## Downloads

The SDK can be downloaded from the [Releases] page, which also lists the
changelog of every version.

[releases]: https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-native/releases

### What is Inside

The SDK bundle contains the following folders:

- `external`: These are external projects which are consumed via
  `git submodules`.
- `include`: Contains the Sentry header file. Set the include path to this
  directory or copy the header file to your source tree so that it is available
  during the build.
- `src`: Sources of the Sentry SDK required for building.

## Platform and Feature Support

The SDK currently supports and is tested on the following OS/Compiler variations:

- 64bit Linux with GCC 9
- 64bit Linux with clang 9
- 32bit Linux with GCC 7 (cross compiled from 64bit host)
- 64bit Windows with MSVC 2019
- 32bit Windows with MSVC 2017
- ~~64bit Windows with MSYS2 + MinGW + Clang~~ _(currently untested)_
- macOS Catalina with most recent Compiler toolchain
- Android API29 built by NDK21 toolchain
- Android API16 built by NDK19 toolchain

The SDK supports different features on the target platform:

- **HTTP Transport** is currently only supported on Windows and platforms that
  have the `curl` library available. On other platforms, library users need to
  implement their own transport, based on the `function transport` API.
- **Crashpad Backend** is currently only supported on Windows and macOS.
- **Breakpad Backend** is currently only supported on Linux.

## Building and Installation

The SDK is developed and shipped as a [CMake] project.
CMake will pick an appropriate compiler and buildsystem toolchain automatically
per platform, and can also be configured for cross-compilation.
System-wide installation of the resulting sentry library is also possible via
CMake.

Building the Crashpad Backend requires a `C++14` compatible compiler.

**Build example**:

```sh
# configure the cmake build into the `build` directory, with crashpad (on macOS)
$ cmake -B build -DSENTRY_BACKEND=crashpad
# build the project
$ cmake --build build --parallel
# install the resulting artifacts into a specific prefix (use the correct config on windows)
$ cmake --install build --prefix install --config Debug
# which will result in the following (on macOS):
$ exa --tree install
install
├── bin
│  └── crashpad_handler
├── include
│  └── sentry.h
└── lib
   ├── libsentry.dylib
   └── libsentry.dylib.dSYM
```

Please refer to the CMake Manual for more details.

**Android**:

The CMake project can also be configured to correctly work with the Android NDK,
see the dedicated [CMake Guide] for details on how to integrate it with gradle
or use it on the command line.

### Compile-Time Options

The following options can be set when running the cmake generator, for example
using `cmake -D BUILD_SHARED_LIBS=OFF ..`.

- `BUILD_SHARED_LIBS` (Default: ON):
  By default, `sentry` is built as a shared library. Setting this option to
  `OFF` will build `sentry` as a static library instead.
  
- `CMAKE_SYSTEM_VERSION`: (Default: depending on Windows SDK version):
  Sets up a minimal version of Windows where sentry-native can be guaranteed to run. 
  Possible values: 
    - `5.1` (Windows XP)
    - `5.2` (Windows XP 64-bit / Server 2003 / Server 2003 R2)
    - `6.0` (Windows Vista / Server 2008)
    - `6.1` (Windows 7 / Server 2008 R2)
    - `6.2` (Windows 8.0 / Server 2012)
    - `6.3` (Windows 8.1 / Server 2012 R2)
    - `10`  (Windows 10 / Server 2016 / Server 2019)

  ​	For Windows versions below than `6.0` it is also necessary to use XP toolchain in case of MSVC compiler (pass `-T v141_xp` to CMake command line).
   Also, you are not able to use Crashpad with XP toolchains, no crashes will be handled at all. 

- `SENTRY_TRANSPORT` (Default: depending on platform):
  Sentry can use different http libraries to send reports to the server.
  - **curl**: This uses the `curl` library for HTTP handling. This requires
    that the development version of the package is available.
  - **winhttp**: This uses the `winhttp` system library, is only supported on
    Windows and is the default there.
  - **none**: Do not build any http transport. This should be used if users
    want to handle uploads themselves
- `SENTRY_BACKEND` (Default: depending on platform):
  Sentry can use different backends depending on platform.
  - **crashpad**: This uses the out-of-process crashpad handler. It is currently
    only supported on Windows and macOS, and used as the default there.
  - **breakpad**: This uses the in-process breakpad handler. It is currently
    only supported on Linux, and used as the default there.
  - **inproc**: A small in-process handler which is supported on all platforms
    except Windows, and is used as default on Linux and Android.
  - **none**: This builds `sentry-native` without a backend, so it does not handle
    crashes at all. It is primarily used for tests.

| Feature    | Windows | macOS | Linux | Android |
| ---------- | ------- | ----- | ----- | ------- |
| Transports |         |       |       |         |

### Build Targets

- `sentry`: This is the main library and the only default build target.
- `crashpad_handler`: When configured with the `crashpad` backend, this is
  the out of process crash handler, which will need to be installed along with
  the projects executable.
- `sentry_test_unit`: These are the main unit-tests, which are conveniently built
  also by the toplevel makefile.
- `sentry_example`: This is a small example program highlighting the API, which
  can be controlled via command-line parameters, and is also used for
  integration tests.

## Known Issues

- Attachments are currently in _Preview_ and may not be available to your
  organization. Please see [Event Attachments] for more information.

## Development

Some external dependencies, such as `crashpad` are used via `git submodules`.
When working with this repository, make sure to check out the submodules
recursively.

    $ git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-native.git

Or when working with an existing clone:

    $ git submodule update --init --recursive

Alternatively, the `make setup` target will do that for you, and might be
extended in the future if other dependencies are added.

### Running Tests

The SDK ships with a unit-test suite based on [acutest]. Additionally, the
`sentry_example` executable is also used for integration tests which are run
via `pytest`.
The unit-tests are built as a separate `sentry_test_unit` executable.

On macOS and Linux, the _top-level Makefile_ contains a convenience command to
run tests:

```sh
make test
```
