# Changelog

## 0.2.1

- Added Breakpad support on Linux
- Implemented fallback `debug-id` on Linux and Android for modules that are
  built without a `build-id`
- Fixes issues and added CI for more platforms/compilers, including 32-bit Linux
  and 32-bit VS2017
- Further improvements to the CMake configuration (thanks @madebr
  [#168](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-native/pull/168))
- Added a new `SENTRY_TRANSPORT` CMake option to customize the default HTTP transport

## 0.2.0

- Complete rewrite in C
- Build system was switched to CMake
- Add attachment support
- Better support for custom transports
- The crashpad backend will automatically look for a `crashpad_handler`
  executable next to the running program if no `handler_path` is set.

### Breaking Changes

- The `sentry_uuid_t` struct is now always a `char bytes[16]` instead of a
  platform specific type.
- `sentry_remove_context`: The second parameter was removed.
- `sentry_options_set_transport`:
  This function now takes a pointer to the new `sentry_transport_t` type.
  Migrating from the old API can be done by wrapping with
  `sentry_new_function_transport`, like this:
  ```c
  sentry_options_set_transport(
        options, sentry_new_function_transport(send_envelope_func, &closure_data));
  ```

### Other API Additions

- `size_t sentry_value_refcount(sentry_value_t value)`
- `void sentry_envelope_free(sentry_envelope_t *envelope)`
- `void sentry_backend_free(sentry_backend_t *backend)`
