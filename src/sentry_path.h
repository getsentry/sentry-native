/**
 * NOTE on encodings:
 *
 * All `char` represent OS-dependent encoding. On UNIXes the path encoding is
 * based on the locale settings, which often means UTF-8 (macOS forces it,
 * Android defaults to it on all layers, and many Linux configurations default
 * to it too, but there is much more variety).
 * However, the locale can be set to anything so that we consider paths as an
 * opaque bytestream that we just pass through.
 * On Windows, we use UTF-8 as the canonical narrow string encoding and provide
 * a wide character string as an additional path member `path_w`, which all
 * functions below must keep in sync.
 *
 * If you add a new function that creates paths, you must take care of
 * synchronizing the contents of `path` and `path_w` on Windows. Further must
 * you ensure that `char` on Windows stays independent of the ANSI code page.
 *
 * In particular this means:
 * - always do full conversions between the narrow and wide characters
 * - always use the wide variant of Win32 APIs when leaving the SDK boundary
 *   (the narrow APIs interpret a `char*` according to the configured ACP)
 * - never assume you can calculate the buffer size for one encoding out of the
 *   buffer size for the other (use our string helpers or, if you must, the
 *   Win32 multibyte APIs with `CP_UTF8`!)
